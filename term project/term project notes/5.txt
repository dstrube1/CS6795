"a formal approach to the Turing test. This approach is based on a tool developed within Inferential Erotetic Logic, so called erotetic search scenarios"
from wikipedia: Erotetics or erotetic logic is a part of logic, devoted to logical analysis of questions. It is sometimes called the logic of questions and answers.

"how to select the interrogator (sometimes called the judge) to take part in the TT; the second one, is how should the interrogator run the test."

"Alan Turingâ€™s suggestion here was that the interrogator should be a person who is not an expert in the field of computing machines"

Minimum Intelligent Signal Test

The Loebner Test : how to choose the interrogator (judge).

"the Golden Path Theorem [...] states that, if an initial question is sound and all the initial premises are true, then an [erotetic scenario] contains at least one golden path. This path leads to a true direct answer to the initial question of the [erotetic scenario]."

"the final result of the [Turing test] relies heavily on the knowledge and beliefs of the interrogator"
