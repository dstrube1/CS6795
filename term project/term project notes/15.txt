TT "hinges on the ability of machines to fool people into thinking that they (the machines) are people" - not the same as being intelligent

TT is "widely recognized as a pioneering landmark, but also is now seen as a distraction, designed over half a century ago, and too crude to really measure intelligence"

"the original test, at least in its standard implementations, has turned out to be highly gameable, arguably an exercise in deception rather than " intelligence

"2015 Turing test winner Eugene Goostman, for instance, pretends to be a thirteen-year-old foreigner and proceeds mainly by ducking questions and returning canned one-liners; it cannot see, it cannot think, and it is certainly a long way from genuine artificial general intelligence."

a new suite of tests: the Turing Championships is designed "to move the field forward, toward previously unconquered territory"

"standardized tests developed for children offer one starting point for testing machine intelligence"

"an alternative test called SQUABU (science questions appraising basic under- standing) that aims to asks questions that are easy for people but hard for computers"

* "a crowdsourced comprehension challenge, in which machines will be asked to answer open-ended questions about movies, YouTube videos, podcasts, stories, and podcasts"

"social-emotional intelligence and pro- poses a methodology for designing tests that assess the ability of machines to infer things like motiva- tions and desires (often referred to in the psycholog- ical literature as theory of mind.)"
reminds me of the suddenly increasingly dark questions (which would have been horrifying to a human) I asked ChatGPT which responded emotionlessly

"AI systems that can make significant, even Nobel-worthy, scientific discoveries"

* "a test of commonsense reasoning that is set in a linguistic context"

*: meh, might not even be worth mentioning

"tests, such as a construction challenge (build something given a bag of parts), that focus on four aspects of intelligence: language, per- ception, reasoning, and action" - [6]

"using visual question answering as an essential part of a multimodal challenge to measure intelligence"

"tests where competitors must not only match human behavior but also do so in a way that is consistent with human physiology"

* "a methodology for designing a test that consists of a series of varied events, in order to test several dimensions of intelligence"

"several desirable features for an inducement prize contest, contrasting them with the current Turing test"

"synergy between human and machine, and the development of conjoint superhuman intelligence"
