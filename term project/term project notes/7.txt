alternatives to Turing test: 2 descriptive models for evaluating creative software: 1: "the FACE model which describes creative acts performed by software in terms of tuples of generative acts", and 2: "the IDEA model which describes how such creative acts can have an impact upon an ideal audience, given ideal information about background knowledge and the software development process"

"most AI researchers see it as a distraction from their goals, encouraging a mere trickery of intelligence and ever more sophisticated natural language front ends, as opposed to focussing on real problems" ?!

"Computational Creativity (CC) is a subfield of AI, in which researchers aim to model creative thought by building programs which can produce ideas and artefacts which are novel, surprising and valu- able, either autonomously or in conjunction with humans. There are three main motivations for the study of Computational Creativity:
• to provide a computational perspective on human creativity, in order to help us to understand it (cognitive science);
• to enable machines to be creative, in order to enhance our lives in some way (engineering); and
• to produce tools which enhance human creativity (aids for creative individuals)."

"Creativity can be subdivided into everyday problem-solving, and the sort of creativity reserved for the truly great, in which a problem is solved or an object created that has a major impact on other people. These are respectively known as “little-c” (mundane) and “big-C” (eminent) creativity"

"two notions of evaluation in CC: (i) judgements which determine whether an idea or artefact is valuable or not (an essential criterion for creativity) and (ii) judgements to determine whether a system is acting creatively or not."

"there are huge philosophical problems with using a test based on imitation to evaluate competence in an area of thought which is based on originality"

"the ‘discrimination test’, which is analogous to the TT, in which subjects are played segments of both machine and human-generated music and asked to distinguish between them"

"Hofstadter’s argument that interaction with a system at an arbitrarily deep level can shed great insight into the processes it uses to generate its output"

"an interpretation of the Turing Test which is specifically designed for computer art systems"

"instead of continuing to judge the computer’s capabilities directly against those of the human mind, the potentials of the computer as an ‘alternative intelligence’ can be explored"

"TT forces us into the undesirable position, to paraphrase Hofstadter, of trying to make a machine act like it is not a machine"

[and other criticisms]

The FACE model assumes eight kinds of generative acts, which produce the following kinds of results:
Fp: a method for generating framing information 
Fg: an item of framing information
Ap: a method for generating aesthetic measures 
Ag: an aesthetic measure
Cp: a method for generating concepts
Cg: a concept
Ep: a method for generating expressions of a concept 
Eg: an expression of a concept

IDEA: an (I)terative (D)evelopment (E)xecution (A)ppreciation cycle within which software is engineered and its behaviour is exposed to an audience

"assume an ideal audience of individuals i, which is able to provide two indicators of the effect that an individual creative act, A, has had on them: (a) an indication of their change in well-being, wbi(A), between -1 and 1, with -1 indicating that they felt worse, +1 indicating that they felt better, and 0 indicating ambivalence, and (b) an indication between 0 and 1 of the cognitive effort they spent in trying to appreciate a cre- ative act and the artefact(s) it produced, cei(A)"
