p10:
CogSci is combo of: psychology, AI, linguistics, neuroscience, anthropology, & philosophy
central hypothesis: Thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.

CRUM: Computational-Representational Understanding of Mind

p13:
4 levels of abstraction:
a cognitive theory postulates a set of representational structures and a set of processes that operate on these structures
a computational model makes these structures and processes more precise by interpreting them by analogy with computer programs that consist of data structures and algorithms
program: implementation of the model
platform: OS

p14
stages of the development of cognitive theories: discovery, modification, and evaluation

p15
criteria for evaluating theories of mental representation:
1- Representational power
2- Computational power
3- Psychological plausibility
4- Neurological plausibility
5- Practical applicability

six approaches to mental representation:
logic, rules, concepts, images, cases, and connections

p16
3 kinds higher level thinking:
-problem solving (planning(start state, calculations, intermediate states, goal state), decision making (best path), explanation (why))
-learning
-language (comprehension, utterances, learnability)

p21
Can you think of any alternatives to the computational - representational understanding of mind?
intoxication / drug addiction, hallucination / dreams, religion / mythology / lying, near-death-experience, morality, hypnosis, gullibility, epistemology, amnesia, illusion, subconscious, imagination, free association, games / sports, evolution / sex / love / poetry

p24
Gottlob Frege 1879

p25
Propositional logic: if-then
Modal logic: necessity & possibility
Epistemic logic: knowledge & belief
Deontic logic: moral ideas
predicate logic allows breaking down things that propositional logic requires to treat as whole

p27
Modus ponens: p->q; p, ergo q
Modus tollens: p->q; ~q, ergo ~p

rule of universal instantiation allows the derivation of an instance from a general statement

p30
P(p|q): probability of p given q

p31
planning: trying to figure out how to accomplish a goal
explanation: trying to understand why something happened

p32
abduction: form a hypothesis in order to generate an explanation

p33
Bayes theorem: the probability of a hypothesis given the evidence is equal to the result of multiplying the prior probability of the hypothesis P(h) by the probability of evidence given the hypothesis, all divided by the probability of the evidence;
P(h|e) = {P(h) * P(e|h)} / P(e)
P(h|e) * P(e) = P(h) * P(e|h)

p38
P(p & q) <= P(p): probability of a conjunction is less than or equal to the probability of one of its conjuncts

(logical approach vs mental models: one response to mental model approach is that people are logical, they're just not always very good at it; eg [A]4 vs [IN BAR]21: "should/ought to" is more intuitive than logic rules that would be better understood if they were more clearly explained, eg "Letters are always on one side and numbers on the other- this is a given and not being tested"; another possibility: some people's brains work logically, some do not; or rather, each person is on a spectrum of logicalness)

p40:
The debate between mental logic and mental model accounts of deductive reasoning now involves three of the methodologies of cognitive science: psychological experiments, computational models, and neurological experiments

p43:
Allan Newell, in collaboration with John Laird and Paul Rosenbloom, developed SOAR, a powerful rule-based program that has had many technological and psychological applications

p44:
Rules: If-Then / Condition-Action
can represent:
general info
how to do things / what to do
linguistic regularities
rules of inference
(what else? gather info?: e.g., if (isSomethingTrue()){...})

Sapir-Whorf hypthesis: language (English, Chinese, etc) affects how you think
Cognitive scientists think it goes the other way
How does mind work
Dualism: mind is an abstraction of the brain
Brain: neurons, neurotransmitters, potassium ions
behavior
mind: Goals, beliefs, desires
system view of mind: perception, action, language, reasoning, memory -> organization -> behaviors
cognition boundaries: individual brains, distributed cognition, situated cognition, embodied cognition
limits: is there free will, what is consciousness, what are emotions, is there a soul- not getting into history or philosophy, just the science

p45
fundamental operation of thinking in logic-based system: deduction
fundamental operation of thinking in rule-based system: search

heuristic: time-saving shortcut
inductive generalization: rules formed from examples

p49:
chunking: rule formed from a series other rules
specialization: rule formed from a existing rule modified for a specific situation

p50:
abductive inference: rules-based reasoning
qualitative evaluation: more usage = more useful

p51:
rule-based systems have the most psychological applications of all computational-representational approaches

p53:
the power law of practice:
the rate of learning slows down as more is learned

p58:
If the logarithm of the reaction time in a task is plotted against the logarithm of the number of practice trials, the result is a straight line that slopes downward

p61:
it is cognitively useful to have acquired a package of information that can be applied as a whole

[define concept:
A kind of: idea...
define idea:
A kind of: concept...?]

p63:
spreading activation: loose association of inheritance-related hierarchy of concepts (eg, desk and chair are both a *kind of* furniture, and drawer is a *part of* a desk, desk is *made of* wood)

p67:
where rules come from: they can be innate, formed from experience, or formed from other rules

p78
in AI, analogical reasoning is called case-based reasoning
target analog: new situation
source analog: old situation
